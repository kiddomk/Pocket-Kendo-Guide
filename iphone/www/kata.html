        <p>
          In Ippon-me kata, the uchitachi is in left jodan while the shidachi
          is in right jodan. Both partners advance 3 large steps to the middle.
          The uchitachi strikes a deep men. The shidachi steps back (nuki-waza),
          raising the arms out of the way and then steps inward striking the uchitachi's
          shomen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uchitachi then steps backwards a small step and the shidachi'slowers
          his sword to the center of the uchitachi's face. The shidachi steps
          back one more small step and the shidachi steps forward into left jodan
          exhibiting zanshin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi then steps backwards to chudan kamae as the uchitachi
          resumes chudan kamae. Uchitachi leads to kamae toku and the shidachi
          simultaneously follows.

                Uchitachi must set the pace and tempo of the kata, the shidachi

          In this kata, both participants are in chudan no kamae. After taking
          three large steps forward and searching for a chance to strike, the uchitachi
          cuts to the shidachi's kote.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi responds by stepping diagonally backwards to the left,
          lowering the sword out of the way of the cut. The shidachi then steps
          back in cutting a large kote to the uchitachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the shidachi demonstrates zanshin, the uchitachi steps backwards
          from the left foot returning to the position from which kote was struck
          and simultaneously, the shidachi steps from the left foot to the right
          back to the center. The uchitachi leads to kamae toku and the shidachi
          simultaneously follows.

              </li>
              <li>
                When going up for the swing, make sure that the sword does not go

              <li>
                At zanshin, the spirit should be that of going to the uchitachi's
                chest, but there is no actual physical action in that direction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let the uchitachi lead the timing of the zanshin but you should

        <h2>Sanbon Me 三本目</h2>

        <p>
          In this kata both participants take gedan-no-kamae. Both parties move
          to the center with three large steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in the center the uchitachi begins to raise the sword towards chudan
          and the shidachi follows simultaneously. The uchitachi looks for an opportunity
          and when he finds it thrusts tsuki to the shidachi's suigetsu. The suigetsu
          is the point just below the sternum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi turns the sword blade out to the right and, using the shinogi,
          steps back drawing the uchitachi's sword down and to the right using the
          technique iyasu. The shidachi then thrusts to the uchitachi's chest. The
          uchitachi steps back with the right foot and parries on the left side
          of the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi thrusts again using the whole body but not the arms. This
          action has the spirit of tsuki but is not really tsuki. It leads into
          the section which follows. The uchitachi again parries, this time on the
          right side of the sword. The shidachi then chases the uchitachi down two
          or three steps to the uchitachi's rear.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of this chase, shidachi's sword is in the center of the uchitachi's
          face. After the shidachi shows zanshin, the two return to the center in
          chudan-no-kamae.

                Make sure your tsuki is to just below the sternum of the shidachi
                not the throat or chest.

              <li>Do not raise your left fist during the thrust. </li>
              <li>
                At the point of the shidachi's first thrust, the level of the sprit
                should be 50-50 At the point of the shidachi's second thrust, the
                level of the spirit should be 60-40 in favor of the shidachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you parry the shidachi, at the end of each parry, the kissaki
                should point to the shidachi's throat.
              </li>
              <li>
                All of the parries of the thrusts should be made with the shinogi

              </li>
              <li>
                The Uchitachi will need to turn the body facing away from square
                on each parry. Do not turn as far as hanmi (half turned). On the first
                parry, you face slightly to the right (the right shoulder pulled back.
                On the second one the facing points left (the left shoulder pulled

                    Don't turn your left wrist outside, but keep it broken in. If
                    you point your left wrist to the outside, it will become dead.

                The second thrust is done with the spirit of tsuki but is not actually

        <p>
          The uchitachi steps forward into Hasso-no-kamae. The shidachi steps
          back into Waki gamae. Both move in three steps (not so large as usual).
        </p>
        <p>
          The uchitachi sees the opportunity and moves through Jodan to cut the
          shidachi's men. The shidachi responds simultaneously by moving through
          Jodan and also cutting to the men. Both strike simultaneously (aiuchi)
          stepping forward with the right foot. The two swords wedge in the center
          of the cut and stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both parties lower the sword back to chudan kamae in good distance (see
          below). The uchitachi then thrusts to the right lung of the shidachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi steps forward and to the left with the left foot. The shidachi
          raises the left and right hands high above the head leaving the sword
          blade pointing back and point downwards (Maki-kaeshi). As the shidachi
          completes his step by placing the right foot behind the left, he moves
          the sword over the center of his head and strikes the uchitachi's shomen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exhibit zanshin, and then as the uchitachi steps backwards one step,
          the shidachi draws the sword down to eye level and steps back to the center
          line (right foot, then left foot), and chudan kamae.

          <h3>
            For the Uchitachi

          </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hasso-no-kamae should feel just like hidari-Jodan, however the right
                fist should be down towards the right shoulder and the tsuba should
                be even with the mouth. The tsuba should be one fist to the right
                of the mouth. To make this kamae, step forwards with the right foot
                to Jodan and then slowly lower to Hasso.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make certain your three steps to the center are quite a bit smaller
                than the usual three steps.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ai-uchi cut is delivered from a far distance (to-ma) where you
                see a chance and must act on it immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you go through Jodan to the ai-uchi cut, your jodan should be
                only 'tall' enough to allow you to view the Shidachi under your arms.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cut for men should feel huge not small (just like Ippon-me),
                both arms must be fully extended at the end of the cut.
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the cut is huge, and the distance is large, you must finish
                the cut completely extended. You must be very careful about the distance
                from which you make the cut and the distance you move in during the
                cut.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you lower to chudan after ai-uchi, feel like the shinogi of the
                swords will be scraping each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                If as you lower to chudan, you feel the distance is too close, you
                may adjust backwards to proper ma- ai.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your tsuki should be to the uchitachi's right lung (your left side).
              </li>
              <li>
                For the tsuki, slant your blade slightly by turning your right palm
                on top a bit.
              </li>
              <li>During the tsuki, look into the shidachi's face. </li>
              <li>
                After the maki kaeshi is applied to your thrust, your kissaki will
                droop a bit.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must lead the way back to chudan. Do not wait for the shidachi
                to move.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step back to ai-chudan first with your left and then your right
                foot.
              </li>

              <li>
                In Waki-gamae, the point of your sword should be slightly lower
                than gedan. Your body facing is hidari hanmi (left shoulder half turned
                forward). The cutting edge should be diagonally downward to the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make certain your three steps to the center are quite a bit smaller

              <li>
                Do not adjust the distance as you go down into chudan. Only the
                uchitachi may move to adjust distance at this point in time.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the maki-kaeshi, make sure that the blade is pointing to the
                rear.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make the maki-kaeshi very large by raising the left fist high over
                your head.
              </li>
              <li>The zanshin is like nihon-me feeling, but not motion. </li>

                Wait for the uchitachi to begin stepping back before you go back

          In this kata, uchitachi takes left jodan. The shidachi raises the chudan

          big steps to the center and look for an opportunity.

        <p>
          The uchitachi strikes towards the shidachi's shomen. The shidachi steps

          men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next the shidachi steps back. First drawing the sword down to the uchitachi's

        <p>
          As the uchitachi begins to come back to chudan, the shidachi steps back

                Don't raise the sword too far back as you continue your suri-age

          three steps to the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the center, the shidachi raises the sword point towards chudan looking
          for an opportunity to attack. the uchitachi attempts unsuccessfully to
          hold the shidachi's blade down.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it becomes clear that the shidachi will be able to come up into
          a dangerous position, the uchitachi steps back into left jodan. The shidachi
          pursues pointing the kissaki towards the uchitachi's left fist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pressure forces the uchitachi to step back again into chudan. The
          shidachi adjusts kamae back to chudan but does not step in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, the uchitachi cuts a small kote. The shidachi counters
          with suri-age kote, stepping to the left (left foot then right foot).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Uchitachi steps back diagonally to his left. The shidachi follows
          stepping forward with his left foot and then assuming left jodan kamae.
          Shidachi exhibits zanshin. The shidachi then steps back (right foot, left
          foot) to the center (diagonally back to the left), and the uchitachi returns
          to the center (right foot, left foot) as well (diagonally forward to the
          right).

                As the shidachi comes up towards chudan you now lower a bit to try

              <li>
                The movement up to Jodan and back down to Chudan should be done

              <li>
                Just as you do for Gohon-me, cut the kote straight down to just
                below the wrist. At the point in time where the shidachi applies the
                suri-age waza, your sword dies and falls off down to your left.
              </li>
              <li>
                You must lead the move to zanshin. Do not wait for the shidachi
                to push you back.
              </li>
              <li>
                After your kote is hit, when you step backwards do not turn your
                body facing towards the shidachi, but instead straight forward. This
                will mean that your chest will be angled so that the left shoulder
                is somewhat further away from the shidachi's body than your right
                shoulder.
              </li>
              <li>
                After you have moved backwards following the shidachi's strike to
                your kote, the point of your sword will be a bit to the left and the
                blade will be a bit to the right of vertical since your sword is still
                dead.
              </li>

          <h3>
            For the Shidachi

          </h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As you come up from gedan to chudan, your seme should be directed
                between the fists of the uchitachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the shidachi steps back to Jodan immediately pursue and assume
                the same kamae that you do in Gohon-me (point of sword pointing to
                left fist, but blade straight up and down).
              </li>
              <li>
                Do the suri-age by drawing a small counterclockwise semi-circle
                to the right with your sword.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make certain that your waza is suri-age and not harai. In particular,
                do not beat the uchitachi's sword downward, but use the semi-circle
                to stroke it upwards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure that in following from the suri-age to the kote you do
                not make too large a motion. This is a small kote, and you should
                always see the uchitachi from above your arms rather than below and
                between your arms as in other kata.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Uchitachi leads the timing for zanshin by stepping backwards.
                You must simultaneously follow feel like you thrust to the Uchitachi's
                face prior to assuming Jodan.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the time when you do the Jodan/zanshin, your left heel is at
                the original center line (front to back center line where the swords
                originally crossed).
              </li>
              <li>
                Following the Jodan/zanshin, step back to the original position
                from first your right foot and then your left foot, finally recovering
                your right foot.

          Both partners assume chudan kamae. After stepping into the center look
          for an opportunity to attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uchitachi makes a thrust to the shidachi. The shidachi receives
          this thrust by stepping backwards and pushing the sword forwards and upwards
          keeping contact between the shinogi of his sword and the uchitachi's.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both partners resume chudan-no-kamae. The Uchitachi makes a large shomen
          and the shidachi responds with men nuki do moving diagonally forward to
          the right and finishing the cut on his right knee.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing the cut, the shidachi turns to face the uchitachi and,
          while remaining on one knee, assumes waki-gamae. The Uchitachi turns to
          face the shidachi and the shidachi moves to chudan-no-kamae by way of
          jodan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uchitachi steps backwards drawing the shidachi up to both feet with
          the right foot forwards in a normal chudan kamae. both parties circle
          back to their original positions moving clockwise five steps.

          <h3>
            For the Uchitachi

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Go into the center with a strong ki the level is 50-50 with the
                shidachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make the tsuki with a feeling of scraping the shinogi of the shidachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cutting edge should be pointed slightly to the left and down
                when you make the tsuki.
              </li>
              <li>Don't let your wrist or arm rise too high during the tsuki. </li>
              <li>
                When you return to chudan after the tsuki, the level of the ki should
                be 50-50 between the Uchitachi and Shidachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cut men with a do or die attitude. Throw your life completely away
                as you cut. Raise your sword as you step forward with the left foot
                and cut as you step forward with the right foot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cut straight down. It is easy to accidently cut towards the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you complete the cut, you will momentarily lose sight of the
                Shidachi. Immediately look back to your left rear at the shidachi
                after you cut finishes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you complete the cut, your body posture should break slightly.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you turn to face the Shidachi again, pivot on the right foot,
                first raising the sword to roughly jodan as you turn and then lowering
                to chudan as you complete the pivot.
              </li>
              <li>
                The shidachi pushes you back as they stand up into chudan. Don't
                lead the shidachi back.
              </li>

                Receive the tsuki by extending out with the cutting edge turned
                down to the left.
              </li>
              <li>
                The feeling when receiving the tsuki is almost like ai-tsuki, but
                don't lift your arms or fists too high. The contact point should be
                shoulder height when you complete the extension.
              </li>
              <li>
                Receive the tsuki on the shinogi of the mono-uchi. The kissaki should
                be slightly higher than chudan.
              </li>
              <li>Returning to chudan, the level of the ki should be 50-50 </li>
              <li>
                The Do should be struck with katsugi waza (sword goes to the left
                shoulder on your first step.
              </li>
              <li>The Do should be struck on your second step. </li>
              <li>Never lose sight of the Uchitachi. </li>
              <li>
                At the completion of the Do (Zanshin), both arms should be extended
                and the sword is almost pararllel to the ground. Blade should be facing
                to the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you allow enough time to exhibit zanshin completely prior
                to taking Wake-gamae after the cut. Don't take Wake-gamae immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you go to wake-gamae, your right knee is a fixed point around
                which that leg pivots so that both feet face the uchitachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                The shidachi moves up to standing chudan first, and the uchidachi
                simultaneously follows by stepping backwards (shidachi pushes up rather
                than being pulled).

          The uchitachi moves through Jodan and cuts at the shidachi's shomen.

          After cutting the shomen, the shidachi reaches out with the left hand

                The initial kamae points to the opponent's chest with the sword
                vertical (no slant on the blade).
              </li>
              <li>
                When you cover the opponent's blade as he raises, you do so by pointing
                the sword to your left and slanting the cutting edge to the right
                (think of holding down with the bottom part of the shinogi).
              </li>
              <li>
                As you advance to keep the pressure on the Uchitachi after he goes
                to waki-gamae, your sword goes back to a centered chudan, however
                the height is now at the throat, not the chest.
              </li>
              <li>
                As you step out to the left, shift your body facing to be square
                to the opponent. Do not move so that the body facing is away from
                them at the contact point of the uke-nagashi.
              </li>
              <li>
                The final position of your body should be much less than 45 degrees
                out from the uchitachi.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you grip the uchitachi's right arm. Grip from the top (thumb
                pointing down, wrist broken inward). Grip the arm just above the elbow
                joint, not at the joint. Pressure should be downwards.

        <h2>Kodachi Sanbon Me 小太刀三本目</h2>
        <p>
          The Uchitachi remains in chudan no-kamae. The shidachi, however moves
          to hanmi-gedan. Both sides take three steps into the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the third step, the uchitachi attempts to strike the shidachi's
          shomen. The shidachi responds with suri-age followed by suri-otoshi. Sliding
          up the Uchitachi's blade and then throwing it back towards the Uchitachi's
          right rear side. This breaks the balance and posture of the uchitachi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The uchitachi recovers balance and stepping forward with the left foot
          cuts to the shidachi's do. This cut is received with suri-otoshi, sliding
          down and backwards along most of the blade as the shidachi steps out to
          the left by pivoting on the right foot. The suri-otoshi is completed by
          sliding the kodachi upwards until the two swords are locked at the tsuba
          (during both slides the shinogi are in contact, however at the point when
          the swords lock tsuba, the shidachi turns the kodachi blade down).
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi grips the uchitachi's right arm locking it in place. The
          uchitachi attempts to escape two or three steps backwards but the shidachi
          follows up maintaining this control. The shidachi exhibits zanshin by
          drawing the kodachi to his right hip and pointing it towards the uchitachi's
          stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shidachi withdraws back to the original starting position beginning
          with the left leg this time (about 3 steps left right left). The uchitachi
          returns to the starting position with a single step (right and left recovery).
        </p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the shidachi goes into hanmi gedan, do not adjust your kamae
                downward at all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not swing the sword up during step two. Instead get both the
                up and downswing in during the third step.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hit the do slightly higher than normally. This makes the shidachi's
                suri-otoshi somewhat easier. Do not hit the do low.
              </li>
              <li>You can retreat either two or three steps. </li>
              <li>
                Remember to return to the center after the zanshin is exhibited
                leading with your right foot. You will move only one step back (with
                the shidachi's 3'd step) to get to the center.
              </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first suri-age/suri-otoshi, Don't raise your right arm above
                horizontal (shoulder height). You will need to break your wrist upwards
                to reach the Uchitachi's sword.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the first suri-age/suri-otoshi, catch the uchitachi's sword at
                your datotsu-bu. Do not catch it too close to his point, but more
                down at the bottom of the datotsu-bu or even further towards his tsuba.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finish the first suri-otoshi with the point of the kodachi outside
                the frame of the uchitachi's body. The "throw" should be back towards
                the uchitachi more than to your left (his right).
              </li>
              <li>
                When you grip the Uchitachi's arm, grip slightly above the elbow
                joint and from the right side (thumb on top, pointing to your right).
                The lock is accomplished by pressure towards the inside with your
                left arm to his right arm, while at the same time pressing the katana
                downwards with the kodachi.
              </li>
              <li>The chase can be either two or three steps. </li>
              <li>
                Remember to withdraw back to the center by stepping first with your
                left foot not your right foot. You will move three steps back to get
                to the center.
